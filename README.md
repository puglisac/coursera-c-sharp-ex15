# Exercise 15: If and Switch Statements

This is an exercise for the coursera course [Introduction to C# Programming and Unity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-programming-unity)

### Problem 1 - Create and use a menu using an if statement

Start up your IDE and create a new Console Application project named Exercise15. Save the project in a reasonable location on the computer.

Create a menu of choices for your user. It should look like the following (without the extra blank lines):

```
Menu:  
1−NewGame  
2−LoadGame  
3−Options  
4−Quit
```

You should then prompt for and read in the user’s choice as an integer.

Your application should print an appropriate response confirming their choice, such as:

`Loading  game...`

To summarize, your application should:

* Display the menu

* Prompt for and read in the user’s choice

* Store the choice in an appropriate variable

* Using an if statement, determine which menu option the user selected, printing an appropriate message for the option selected

* If the user enters something other than a menu option, print an appropriate message

### Problem 2 - Use a switch statement

* Using a switch statement, determine which menu option the user selected, printing an appropriate message for the option selected

* If the user enters something other than a menu option, print an appropriate message
